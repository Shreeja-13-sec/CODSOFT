TASK 1 - PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
  
  This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. The design is responsive and user-friendly, allowing visitors to learn more about me and my work. Feel free to explore the code and see how I've structured the portfolio to highlight my achievements and capabilities.
